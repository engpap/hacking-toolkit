For each DNS response packet captured, the program analyzes the response.
It extracts the transaction ID (TXID), the queried domain, and the response IP address(es).

Attack Detection:
The script maintains a dictionary to store information about previous DNS responses.
For each new response, it checks if there is an existing entry with the same TXID and domain but different IP addresses.
If such an entry is found, and the responses arrived within a defined time threshold, it raises an alert indicating a potential DNS poisoning attack.

Avoiding False Positives:
To avoid false positives, such as those that might be caused by DNS-based load balancing, the program only raises an alert if the DNS responses meet the attack detection criteria and arrive within a defined time threshold (0.01 seconds by default).

Limitations and Assumptions:
- The program assumes that if two DNS responses with the same TXID and queried domain but different IP addresses arrive within the specified time threshold, it could be a result of DNS-based load balancing and not an attack. This might not always be the case.
- In order to log malicious and legitimate response, the program interprets the presence of a private IP address in a DNS resolution as an indication of a malicious response.
- The program does not verify the authenticity of the DNS responses or the integrity of the DNS protocol itself.
