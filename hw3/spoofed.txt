Frame 5 is the spoofed response.
Frame 6 is the legitimate response.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legitimate and spoofed DNS responses differs for:

Arrival Time:
The time of capture varies, with Frame 5 being captured slightly earlier than Frame 6.

Internet Protocol:
The total length field varies between the two frames. Frame 5 has a length of 114 bytes, whereas Frame 6 has a length of 146 bytes.
The header checksum differs between the two frames.

Identification Value:
For Frame 5 -> 0x0001 (1)
For Frame 6 -> 0x6cfd (27901)
The spoofed response has a notably low "Identification" value of 0x0001.
The legitimate response uses 0x6cfd, a much higher value.
The disparity in "Identification" values between the two frames suggests potential DNS spoofing in Frame 5.

Flags:
The spoofed response indicates a successful query response, whereas the legitimate response indicates that the queried name does not exist (no such name).

Answers, Authority RRs, and additional RRs differ between the frames. Frame 5 has 1 answer, while Frame 6 has 1 authority RR and 1 additional RR.
- Authoritative Nameservers Section
The legitimate response has a section on authoritative nameservers, specifically an SOA record, detailing essential information like the primary name server and the responsible authority's mailbox.
The spoofed response does not have any data provided for the authoritative nameservers in the given image.
- Additional Records Section
The spoofed response has an additional record related to the root with details on OPT and EDNS0 version.
The legitimate response does not have any information provided in the "Additional records" section in the provided image.

Other Observations: The spoofed response (Frame 5) mentions "Retransmitted response, Original response in: 5" and "Retransmission: True". 
This could indicate repeated attempts to send the response, a common technique in DNS spoofing where the attacker tries to get their malicious response accepted by bombarding the resolver with fake responses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legitimate and spoofed DNS responses are the same for:

Frame Information:
Both frames have the same length, although Frame 6 is slightly larger in captured bits.
Both frames utilize the UDP protocol, a common protocol for DNS traffic.

Ethernet II, Src/Dst MAC Addresses:
Source and destination MAC addresses are consistent between the two frames.

Internet Protocol, Src/Dst IP Addresses:
Both frames show identical source and destination IP addresses.

User Datagram Protocol, Src/Dst Ports:
Source port is the same for both, which is 53 (DNS).
Destination port is also consistent between the frames.

Domain Name System (response):
Both are marked as DNS responses.
The transaction ID, a unique ID for each DNS query-response pair, is consistent between the two frames.
