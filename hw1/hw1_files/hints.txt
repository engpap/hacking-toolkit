Salt : Maximum of 5 digits

Leet : Start by using the simple and most popular transformations (characters->numbers).
A leet transformation can be applied to parts of the string (e.g., only a->4) as well as to each character (if there is a valid mapping) individually. 


Caesar cipher: Use ASCII table for transformations for the given indexes. When transforming characters use the indexes 65-122 and for the numbers 48-57. Remember to stay in the bounds.

Substitution cipher : The alphabet used for the substitution cipher is a shifted english alphabet. You need to think how you can map the english alphabet to the shifted alphabet. The encrypted text is a typical set of sentences, part of a larger text. You should be able to decrypt every word and form the sentences without changing any punctuation.
