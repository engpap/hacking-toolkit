call me ishmael. some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly november in my soul, whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet, and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking peoples hats off, then, i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can.
